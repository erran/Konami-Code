{"google":"","body":"### Welcome to the Konami Code iOS page.\r\nThis is the official page for my Konami Code iOS project. The project was create specifically because I hadn't seen any open source code to add the Konami Code Easter egg to one of my iPhone apps. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAs of 2012, I, Erran Carey (@ipwnstuff)  am the only person to touch this code as of my knowledge. Hit me up to contribute to the code because it was just a little Easter egg I added to my app Bomb Unit.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf your having trouble with any part of my Konami Code iOS source code get in contact with me! I'll be sure to make some documentation at a later date for now  contact me at e@ipwnstuff.com or [@ipwnstuff](http://www.twitter.com/#!/ipwnstuff) and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.","name":"Konami Code","note":"Don't delete this file!
